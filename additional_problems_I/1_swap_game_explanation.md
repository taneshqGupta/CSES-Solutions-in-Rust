## Hint
BFS state-space search: model each game configuration as a node, use BFS to find minimum moves from initial state to target state, representing moves as swaps between adjacent positions.

## Explanation
The solution treats the swap game as a graph problem where each game configuration is a node and moves are edges between configurations. It uses BFS to find the shortest sequence of swaps to transform the initial configuration into the target sorted state. The algorithm represents each configuration as a string or vector, uses a queue for BFS exploration, and a set/map to track visited states to avoid cycles. For each current configuration, it generates all possible next states by swapping adjacent positions, adds unvisited states to the queue, and tracks the parent relationship for path reconstruction. The search continues until the target configuration "123456789" is reached. Since BFS explores states level by level, it guarantees finding the minimum number of moves required. The solution handles the exponential state space efficiently by using appropriate data structures for state representation and visited tracking, ensuring that each unique configuration is processed only once during the search.
