## Hint
Use Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to efficiently track connected components as roads are built. After each road construction, update the number of components and the size of the largest component.

## Explanation
The solution uses Union-Find data structure to solve the dynamic connectivity problem where roads are built between cities and we need to track the number of connected components and the size of the largest component after each road construction. Initially, there are n separate cities (each forming its own component of size 1). For each road construction between cities a and b, the algorithm finds their root representatives using path compression for efficiency. If they belong to different components, it merges them using union by size (attaching smaller component to larger one), decreases the total component count by 1, and updates the largest component size. If they're already connected, nothing changes. The Union-Find structure with path compression and union by size provides nearly O(1) amortized time per operation. After each road construction, the solution outputs the current number of components and the size of the largest component, efficiently handling up to m road constructions.
