## Hint
Tree DP with rerooting for sum of distances: compute sum of distances from each node to all others using subtree size information and rerooting to avoid O(n²) complexity.

## Explanation
The solution computes the sum of distances from each node to all other nodes using tree dynamic programming with rerooting optimization. The algorithm first performs DFS to compute subtree sizes and the sum of distances from an arbitrary root (node 1) to all other nodes. For each node, it calculates the total distance contribution from its subtree by summing (distance × subtree_size) for each child. The second phase uses rerooting: when transitioning the root from parent to child, it adjusts the distance sums by removing the child's subtree contribution from the parent's total and adding the contribution from the "new subtree" (everything not in the child's original subtree). The key insight is that when rerooting from parent p to child c, distances to nodes in c's subtree decrease by 1 each, while distances to nodes outside increase by 1 each. This allows updating the sum incrementally rather than recomputing from scratch, achieving O(n) complexity instead of the naive O(n²) approach of running DFS from every node.
