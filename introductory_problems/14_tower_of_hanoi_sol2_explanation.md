## Hint
Alternative recursive implementation: same divide-and-conquer strategy as solution 1 but with different parameter handling or optimization approach.

## Explanation
This solution follows the identical recursive divide-and-conquer strategy as the first Tower of Hanoi solution. The core algorithm remains the same: to move n disks from source to destination, first recursively move n-1 disks to the auxiliary tower, then move the bottom disk to the destination, and finally recursively move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination. The difference lies in implementation details such as parameter ordering, variable naming, or possibly minor optimizations in how the moves are stored or processed. Both solutions generate the same optimal sequence of 2^n - 1 moves and maintain the fundamental constraint that larger disks never sit on smaller disks. The recursive structure naturally handles the exponential complexity of the problem while producing the mathematically optimal solution.
