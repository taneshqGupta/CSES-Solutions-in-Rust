## Hint
The problem cannot be solved in polynomial time. It is NP-complete. Also, the constraint is 20.

## Solution
Obviously we need to go over all the possible groupings. How many possible groupings you ask? There are exactly 2^n possible groups for n apples. This is because every apple has two independent choices. Now, to solve it iteratively and using bitwise operations, we must realise that we can represent every possible group as a string of length n comprised of 0 and 1. There are 2^n possible strings, and in fact, the first string represents the integer 0 (all n bits being zero) and the last string represents the integer "2^n - 1" (all n bits being one). Now you can imagine that the rest of the strings in between represent all the numbers between 0 and (2^n - 1). Thus, we can see that we can represent all possible group formations as integers from 0 to "2^n - 1". Now iterative over all these numbers, access each bit and if it is one, add its weight to first group and vice-versa. Rest is straight forward. (To access j'th bit from right (1st being LSB), all we have to do is right shift by j bits which results in the j'th bit becoming the new LSB. Now we just check if the resulting number is odd or even, if odd, the LSB is 1 (i.e; j'th bit is 1) else LSB is 0 (j'th bit is 0). Another way to check is by doing '&1 == 1' which is basically the same thing.)
