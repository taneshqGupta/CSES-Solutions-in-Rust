## Hint
Binary search with parity constraints: use the alternating color pattern to eliminate half the search space by checking if three positions follow the expected color sequence.

## Explanation
The solution uses binary search to find adjacent chairs of the same color by exploiting the alternating color pattern constraint. The key insight is that if chairs alternate colors perfectly, then chairs at positions with the same parity (both odd or both even) should have the same color. The algorithm maintains a search range [low, high] and repeatedly queries three positions: low, mid, and high. It checks if the color pattern between (low, mid) or (mid, high) violates the alternating constraint using a "works" function that verifies expected parity-based coloring. If (low, mid) follows the pattern, the violation must be in the right half, so it searches [mid, high]. If (mid, high) follows the pattern, the violation is in the left half, so it searches [low, mid]. When the range narrows to two adjacent positions, it checks if they have the same color, indicating the found violation point. The memoization ensures each position is queried at most once, keeping within the query limits.
