## Hint
Reconstruct permutation from inversion counts, then use pancake sorting: build the original array from inversion data, then iteratively move each element to its correct position using range reversals.

## Explanation
The solution first queries all positions to get the inversion count for each, then reconstructs the original permutation using these counts. For reconstruction, it processes positions from right to left: for position i, it finds the (inversions[i]+1)-th smallest remaining number and places it at position i, then removes that number from available choices. After reconstruction, it performs pancake sorting to arrange the array. For each target value i from 1 to n, it finds the current position of value i, then performs a range reversal from position i-1 to the found position to bring value i to its correct location. Each reversal operation is output as a query, and the algorithm continues until the array is sorted (indicated by receiving 0 inversions). This approach efficiently combines permutation reconstruction from inversion counts with the pancake sorting algorithm to systematically fix the array ordering.
