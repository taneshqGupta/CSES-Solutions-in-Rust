## Hint
Optimized approach using advanced data structures: similar insertion strategy as solution 1 but with more efficient data structure (likely AVL tree) to reduce time complexity.

## Explanation
This solution implements the same conceptual approach as solution 1 but uses more advanced data structures to optimize the insertion operations. While solution 1 uses simple array insertion which takes O(n) time per insertion leading to O(n²) total time, this solution employs AVL tree to maintain the sorted sequence. The binary search for finding insertion positions remains the same with O(log n) queries per element, but the actual insertion and maintenance operations are optimized to O(log n) per element rather than O(n). This optimization is crucial for larger constraints where the O(n²) insertion cost would cause time limit exceeded (TLE). The overall query complexity remains O(n log n) but the computational time complexity improves to O(n log n), making it suitable for cases where n can be as large as 100,000 instead of just 1,000.
